title: Container Storage Interfaces

:::caution[Work In Progress]

This program, all its features and its general design, are all a Work-In-Progress. It is not done and not widely available.

All code and docs are considered Pre-Beta drafts

:::

Container Storage Interfaces, better known as "CSI", are used to connect storage to kubernetes PVCs.
We at TrueCharts and ClusterTool do not include any form of storage, as everyone has their own preferences.

Guides under this section give some user-made examples of CSI storage options available.
However, as those are user-made, they are not covered by TrueCharts Discord Support.
